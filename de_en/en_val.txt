I'm 19.
Be nice.
Beat it.
Beat it.
Go away!
Go away.
Goodbye!
He came.
Help us.
Help us.
I'm hit!
Lock it.
Wait up.
Wake up!
Be brave.
Can I go?
Get away!
Get away!
Get away!
Get away!
Get away!
Get lost!
Get lost!
How deep?
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
I am fat.
I use it.
I'm bald.
I'm full.
It's Tom.
Let's go!
She came.
Sit down!
Speak up!
Stand up!
Tell Tom.
Terrific!
Tom knew.
Tom knew.
Tom's up.
Watch us.
We're OK.
Answer me.
Call home!
Calm down.
Go get it.
Here's $5.
I fainted.
I got mad.
I knew it.
I like it.
I love it.
I made it.
I miss it.
I took it.
I'll cook.
I'm happy.
I'm sober.
I'm upset.
Is it bad?
Let us go.
Seriously?
Sit still.
Stay thin.
Stop here.
Take over.
They lied.
Tom moved.
Tom voted.
Tom works.
We're hot.
We've won!
Who'll go?
Aim higher.
Are you OK?
Be careful.
Did Tom go?
Don't jump!
Drink this.
Find a job.
Forgive us.
Have faith.
He gave in.
He is kind.
How absurd!
How clever!
I am a man.
I am ready.
I can stay.
I can't go.
I canceled.
I eat here.
I hate Tom.
I loved it.
I made tea.
I need ice.
I'll hurry.
I'll shoot.
I'll start.
I'm a cook.
I'm losing.
I'm thirty.
Is it time?
It's bulky.
It's clean.
It's shiny.
It's white.
It's yours.
Jesus wept.
Keep it up!
Keep quiet!
Let Tom in.
Let Tom in.
Let me pay.
Let me see.
Let me try.
Look there.
No comment.
Pick it up.
Run for it!
Start here.
Start here.
Taste this.
That'll do.
That's all.
Tom fought.
Tom is fun.
Tom is mad.
Tom is out.
Tom moaned.
Tom nodded.
Tom yelled.
Tom's fast.
Turn right.
Wait a sec.
We all lie.
We are men.
We buy CDs.
We can pay.
We can win.
We lost it.
We lost it.
We made it.
We're here.
What is it?
Who has it?
Who is she?
Who phoned?
You may go.
You're old.
Be merciful.
Come off it!
Comfort Tom.
Comfort Tom.
Did it work?
Do as I say.
Do you fish?
Eat with us.
Forgive Tom.
Get started.
Go find Tom.
Go for help.
Go with Tom.
Have we met?
He is alone.
He's asleep.
He's wasted.
How are you?
I asked why.
I assume so.
I can't fly.
I can't say.
I got angry.
I like rice.
I like them.
I love beef.
I must obey.
I need help.
I saved you.
I want cash.
I want more.
I want that.
I want this.
I was moved.
I was ready.
I was wrong.
I'll cancel.
I'll get in.
I'll manage.
I'll use it.
I'm 17, too.
I'm a child.
I'm dancing.
I'm dancing.
I'm in debt.
I'm sad now.
I'm sincere.
I'm stunned.
Is it there?
It is foggy.
It saved me.
It'll be OK.
It's a joke.
It's secret.
It's spring.
It's urgent.
It's urgent.
Jump across.
Let's begin.
Let's dance.
Let's do it!
Let's do it!
Make a list.
Nobody knew.
Please stop!
Release Tom.
Say goodbye.
Send Tom in.
Shall we go?
Start again.
Tell Tom no.
Tell Tom no.
Tom blinked.
Tom is busy.
Tom is gone.
Tom is rude.
Tom knew it.
Tom shot me.
Tom slipped.
Tom'll wait.
Tom's flaky.
Tom's happy.
Tom's smart.
Tom's tough.
Trust in me.
Turn around.
Vote for me!
Wake Tom up.
Walk slowly.
We are late.
We found it.
We know him.
We need you.
We'll drive.
We'll stand.
We're armed.
We're broke.
What a pity!
Who are you?
Who cheated?
Who cheated?
Who'll come?
Who's there?
Why is that?
You know me.
You must go.
You're cute.
You're late.
You're vain.
You're wise.
All is quiet.
Are we alone?
Are you busy?
Are you free?
Boil one egg.
Boil one egg.
Can you come?
Come back in.
Come forward.
Come outside.
Come quickly.
Cut that out!
Did Tom know?
Did Tom vote?
Did you call?
Do your best!
Don't forget.
Don't scream.
He has a dog.
He is driven.
He kicked it.
He lost face.
He seems ill.
Here you are.
How barbaric!
How dare you!
I am at home.
I am curious.
I am thirsty.
I apologized.
I don't sing.
I drink milk.
I eat cheese.
I enjoy life.
I hugged Tom.
I love jokes.
I need water.
I see a lion.
I suppose so.
I want a job.
I was shaken.
I'll be good.
I'll be late.
I'll be nice.
I'll get one.
I'm a coward.
I'm innocent.
I'm like Tom.
I'm no rebel.
I'm not rich.
I'm offended.
I'm so sorry.
I'm starving!
I'm starving!
I'm very fat.
I'm very hot.
Iron is hard.
Is Tom right?
Is that a no?
Is this love?
Is this real?
It works now.
It's a curse.
It's bizarre.
It's for you.
It's my book.
It's my life.
Ladies first.
Let Tom sing.
Let's see it.
Mary is tall.
May I go now?
No one cared.
Now I get it.
Pick that up.
Play it cool.
Please hurry.
Put it there.
See you then.
She is upset.
She is wrong.
She stood up.
Stop reading.
Stop yelling!
Tell me more.
That's a lie.
That's great.
They laughed.
They love it.
They sweated.
They're gone.
Things break.
This is hers.
This'll work.
Tom answered.
Tom bit Mary.
Tom can cook.
Tom can swim.
Tom grimaced.
Tom is blind.
Tom is early.
Tom is moody.
Tom is ready.
Tom is witty.
Tom just ate.
Tom may stay.
Tom needs it.
Tom panicked.
Tom ran away.
Tom stutters.
Tom survived.
Tom was gone.
Tom was slow.
Tom's amazed.
Trust no one.
Try these on.
We are happy.
We knew that.
We must obey.
We trust him.
We're dating.
Where are we?
Who built it?
Who panicked?
Who saw what?
Who survived?
Who survived?
Who's joking?
You can rest.
You look fat.
You may look.
You promised.
You survived.
You're a spy.
You're cruel.
You're lying!
You're moody.
You're silly.
You've tried.
You've tried.
Are they dead?
Are they gone?
Are you crazy?
Ask an expert.
Can I ask why?
Did Tom faint?
Did Tom smile?
Did Tom smile?
Did you do it?
Do I know you?
Do it for Tom.
Don't go away.
Get a move on.
He came first.
He's a grouch.
He's no saint.
Help yourself.
How about you?
I admired Tom.
I burned them.
I can't do it.
I cried a lot.
I didn't call.
I feel stupid.
I felt guilty.
I got cheated.
I had no clue.
I had to work.
I hate coffee.
I have a cold.

I looked down.
I must refuse.
I play violin.
I rescued him.
I said thanks.

I was correct.
I'd like that.

I'll get that.
I'll take Tom.
I'm an addict.
I'm an artist.
I'm attentive.
I'm home, Tom.
I'm on my way.
I'm satisfied.
I'm screaming.
I've got that.
Is he looking?
Is it helping?
Is it popular?
Is this Latin?
It hurts here.
It is raining.
It was simple.
It's accurate.
It's the cops!
It's too soon.
It's unlocked.
It's very big.
It's very hot.
It's very new.
Let Tom do it.
Let him enter.
Let's ask him.
Life is crazy.
Lock the door.
Look up there.
Love is blind.
Mine is black.
Mom's working.
My head aches.
My neck hurts.
Nobody called.
Our team lost.
Read this now.
Red is better.
Roll the dice.
She came last.
She is crying.
She is eating.
She was brave.
She was naive.
She's a cutie.
Show yourself.
Shut the door.
Stop shooting.
Stop shooting.
Take only one.
Take us there.
That'll do it.
That's a sign.
The girls won.
The girls won.

We had a plan.
We need tools.
We'll ask Tom.
We'll be late.
We'll do that.
We'll make it.
We're reading.
We're sinking.
We're useless.
We're winners.
We've made it.
Were you sick?
What about me?
What happened?
What is a UFO?
Where's Daddy?
Who says that?
Who's fasting?
Who's fasting?
Whose is this?
Women hate me.
You look busy.
You look fine.
You may enter.
You may enter.
You should go.
You're joking!
You're skinny.
You're skinny.
You're unkind.
A car's coming.
Can I go first?
Can I touch it?
Come back home.
Come here, Tom.
Cut it in half.
Cut it in half.
Cut it in half.
Did you forget?
Do as you want.
Do it your way.
Do it yourself.
Do you have it?
Don't be sorry.
Don't hurt her.
Don't leave us.
Everybody knew.
Everybody sang.
Get me a towel.
Go and ask Tom.
Go wake Tom up.
Hand it to Tom.
Happy New Year!
He almost died.
He came by bus.
He deserved it.
He dislikes me.
He doesn't run.

He is Canadian.
He learns fast.
He looks young.
He loves music.
He owes me one.
He was English.

It was perfect.
It was snowing.
It's a bargain.
It's a classic.
It's a new day.
It's a promise.
It's rush hour.
It's too quiet.
It's up to you.
It's very good.
It's well done.
It's your home.
It's your turn.
Keep Tom quiet.
Keep Tom there.
Keep it on you.
Keep it simple.
Leave me alone.
Leave tomorrow.
Leave us alone.
Let the boy go.
Life is unfair.
Mary is a girl.
Mary is blonde.
Mary likes you.
May I sit here?
Maybe it's Tom.
Men are greedy.
Nobody'll know.
Nobody's happy.
Open this door.
Please come in.
Please stop it.
Pull over here.
Return at once.
School is over.
Science is fun.
She has a cold.
She is talking.
She loves cats.
She trusted me.
She's divorced.
Take that back.
Tell everybody.
That's correct.
That's correct.
That's for you.

That's the law.
That's typical.
They have wine.
They hired Tom.
They look busy.
They loved you.

Are you injured?
Are you jealous?
Are you serious?
Are you serious?
Aren't you cold?
Aren't you late?
Aren't you rich?
Ask Tom instead.
Be careful, Tom.
Boston is great.
Brush your hair.
Can I come over?
Can they see me?
Come back later.
Come in already.
Come on up, Tom.

He hit me twice.
He is a student.
He is very sick.
He is very tall.

Her face lit up.
Here, take this.
How about 12:45?
How did Tom die?
How will it end?
How's your cold?
I am a good boy.
I am in trouble.
I am very happy.
I am very tired.
I asked Tom why.
I ate an orange.
I bought a book.
I burped loudly.
I can afford it.
I can't do that.
I can't do this.
I can't go home.
I couldn't wait.
I cry every day.
I don't need it.
I feel homesick.
I feel relieved.
I felt betrayed.
I get the point.
I get up at six.
I hate this job.
I have to hurry!
I hope Tom wins.

I've enjoyed it.
I've missed Tom.
Is Tom dreaming?
Is Tom sleeping?
Is anybody here?
Is it that hard?
Is it too salty?
Is it too small?
Is this ethical?
It could be Tom.
It is necessary.
It mortifies me.
It sounds great!
It took all day.
It was too late.
It won't matter.
It would be fun.
It's inadequate.
It's news to me.
It's not broken.
It's okay to go.
It's ridiculous.
It's time to go.
It's very small.
Just follow Tom.
Keep practicing.
Let Tom go home.
Let Tom go home.
Let me carry it.
Let's improvise.
Let's turn back.
Life is strange.
Look at the cat.
Look at the sky.
Mary helped Tom.
Never lose hope.
Nobody was home.
Our plan worked.
People like Tom.
Please call him.
Please hurry up!
Please sit down.
Please speak up.
Prices are high.
Read this first.
Rules are rules.
Say you love me.
She admired him.
She stabbed him.
She stabbed him.
She was perfect.
Show us the way.
Somebody called.
Stop right here.
Take everything.
Take everything.
Take no chances.
That isn't fair.
That isn't fair.
That man is Tom.
That won't work!
That'll be nice.
That's a pagoda.
That's a relief.
That's cheating.
That's nonsense.
That's not true.
That's the snag.
That's your job.
The line's busy.

The soup is hot.
There was music.
They are pilots.
They live there.
They'll find us.
They're Russian.
They're at home.

What've you got?
When can we eat?
Where is my son?
Where's my bike?
Where's my desk?

Don't be so sure.
Don't be so sure.
Don't be worried.
Don't get caught.
Don't look at me.
Don't tell on me.
Don't touch that.
Everybody jumped.
Everybody waited.
Everybody's here.
Everyone does it.
Everyone noticed.
Everyone's tired.
Everything is OK.
Explain it to me.
Explain yourself.
Finish your work.
Forget about her.
Get enough sleep.
Get me some, too.
Get on the horse.
Get out of there.
Get to the point.
Give me my money.
Give me that one.
Give me that one.
Give me the book.
Give me the keys.
Give this to Tom.
Go back to sleep.

He can swim well.
He cheated on me.
He doesn't smoke.
He gets up early.
He is still here.
He is up to date.

He ran into debt.
He was in France.
He won't beat me.
He's a grown man.
He's going blind.
He's open-minded.
He's still young.
Here is the bill.
Hey, what's that?
Hey, what's that?
How about a walk?
I abhor violence.
I almost hit Tom.
I also like cake.
I always eat out.
I am a professor.
I am not kidding.
I believe in God.
I believe in you.
I broke that one.
I can name names.

I did it quickly.
I did that a lot.
I didn't like it.
I don't eat much.
I don't think so.
I eat everything.
I feel protected.
I feel safe here.
I gave up on Tom.
I get up at 7:00.
I hate Halloween.
I hate computers.
I hate your guts.
I hit a home run.
I hope Tom comes.
I know it myself.
I know it's hard.
I know the drill.
I let in the cat.
I like Australia.
I like doughnuts.
I like your dogs.

I'm nearly ready.
I'm nervous, too.
I'm not sure why.
I'm not watching.
I'm right-handed.
I'm working hard.
I'm your brother.
I've got nothing.

It belongs to us.
It can't be done.
It interested me.
It is time to go.
It isn't obvious.
It takes courage.
It was hilarious.
It was his fault.
It wouldn't hurt.
It's Tom's house.
It's a good book.
It's just a game.
It's like a drug.
It's magnificent.
It's not illegal.
It's not logical.
It's pretty cold.
It's what I want.
Just follow them.
Keep a cool head.
Leave them alone.
Leave this to me.

Let me do my job.
Let me handle it.
Let's cross here.

Lie on the couch.
Mary is graceful.
My eyes are blue.
My glass is full.
My pulse is weak.
My toy is broken.
Never tell a lie.
No one is coming.
No one knows yet.
No one responded.
No pain, no gain.
Nobody loves war.
Nobody must know.
Now I understand.
Perhaps it's Tom.
Please come here.
Please follow me.
Please let me in.
Please let me in.
Please wait here.
Pump up the tire.
Quit touching me.
Read that for me.
Read the article.

Stop daydreaming.
Stop right there.

Judge for yourself.
Just say yes or no.

Let's stay focused.
Love doesn't exist.
Make it short, Tom.
Make love, not war.
My legs still hurt.
My lips are sealed.
No one looks happy.
Nothing's going on.
Now it's your turn.
Peel the cucumbers.
Peel the cucumbers.
People are strange.
Please look for it.
Please take a bath.
Please wait for me.
Read it to me, Tom.
Send me a postcard.

Shut up and listen!
Stop staring at me.
Take off your mask.
Take that box away!
Take what you want.
Tell me what to do.
Tell us what to do.
Thanks for helping.
Thanks for the tip.
That can't be true.

I wish Tom was here.
I wish you'd listen.
I'll be around back.
I'll check the list.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I'll give it to Tom.
I'll go in a minute.
I'll read this book.
I'll return at 6:30.
I'm a good listener.
I'm about to go out.
I'm afraid of dying.
I'm afraid of dying.
I'm being sarcastic.
I'm counting on you.
I'm counting on you.
I'm dying of hunger.
I'm fine, thank you.
I'm forty years old.
I'm glad we saw Tom.
I'm in my apartment.
I'm in the hospital.
I'm indebted to you.
I'm more than happy.
I'm not a celebrity.
I'm not a good liar.
I'm not married yet.
I'm still your boss.
I'm taking this one.
I'm very hungry now.
I'm waiting for you.
I'm worried for you.
I've just come home.
I've made a mistake.
I've seen you on TV.
Is Tom under arrest?
Is that Tom's house?
Is that all we need?
Is that from a book?
Is that your sister?
Is this all we need?
Is this good French?
Is this your pencil?
It is a little cold.
It is only too true.
It isn't a prophecy.
It may be important.
It was excruciating.
It was hard as rock.
It was pretty close.
It was really cheap.
It wasn't expensive.
It wasn't very good.
It'll come in handy.
It'll rain for sure.
It's a family trait.
It's about this big.
It's free of charge.
It's hip and trendy.
It's just a fantasy.
It's not worth much.
It's starting again.
It's totally normal.
It's your own fault.
Keep me in the loop.
Leave out this word.
Leave the door open.
Let Mary do her job.
Let Tom come aboard.
Let me have a taste.
Let me look into it.
Let the matter drop.
Let's do this later.
Let's go to a movie.
Let's try something.
Let's try something.
Let's try something.
Let's try this cake.
Look after yourself.
Mary is very pretty.
Maybe Tom was wrong.
My feet are swollen.
My hobby is cooking.
My house is haunted.
My life has changed.
My notebook is pink.
My shirt was ruined.
My sister has a job.
My trousers are wet.
Never trust anybody.
No one can help you.
No one can stop Tom.
Nobody cares for me.
Nobody did anything.
Nobody saw anything.
Nothing was working.
Our work never ends.
Peanuts aren't nuts.
Please do something.
Please don't bother.
Please don't mumble.
Please feed the dog.
Please listen to us.
Please take me home.
Put the bracelet on.
Respect your elders.
She can't afford it.
She has gone abroad.

She kept on talking.
She likes that bass.
She still loves him.
She understands him.
She wants an iPad 4.
She was alone there.
She watched him eat.
She went on working.
She won the contest.
Stop calling me Tom.
Take Tom for a swim.
Thanks for the food.
Thanks for the hint.
That hurts! Stop it!
That was very funny.
That'd be dangerous.
That's Tom's mother.
That's good to know.
That's his business.
That's not my fault.
That's sweet of you.
That's the only way.
That's why I'm here.
The TV doesn't work.
The butter went bad.
The car didn't move.
The cat drinks milk.
The dog followed me.
The house is pretty.
The lake was frozen.
The room was packed.
The ship is sinking.
The ship was at sea.
The sirens went off.
The socks smell bad.
There are no spoons.
There's a lot to do.
There's no one here.
These must be Tom's.
These things happen.
They are my friends.
They can't hear you.
They cannot stop it.
They died in battle.
They made fun of me.
They seem very busy.
They won't find you.
They won't help you.
They're doing great.
They're pretty loud.
They're proud of me.
This car runs great.
This is good coffee.
This is interesting.
This is the problem.
This is unfortunate.
This is what I want.
This isn't about me.
This rarely happens.
This screw is loose.
This seems unlikely.
Those are my orders.

Tom yelled for help.
Tom, how's it going?
Try it out yourself.
Two tickets, please.
Unwrap it carefully.
Wait inside the car.
We all have secrets.
We are under attack.
We can't allow this.
We can't fight here.
We didn't plan this.
We enjoyed swimming.
We had a rough time.
We have enough time.
We hope we're wrong.
We just need a plan.
We know Tom is here.
We love coming here.
We reached our goal.
We should get going.
We thought you knew.
We thought you knew.
We'll stop you, Tom.
We're all prisoners.
We're going in here.
We're not going out.
We're not very good.
We've got a visitor.
What are you making?
What are your plans?
What did he look up?
What good are those?
What was I thinking?
What was the result?
What're you reading?
What's Tom given us?
What's it look like?
What's the big idea?
What's the time now?
What's this key for?
What's today's plan?
What's today's plan?
What's your day off?
When does it arrive?
When is your flight?
When will you leave?
Where could they be?
Where have you been?
Where is your money?
Where's your friend?
Who is your teacher?
Whose plan was that?
Why are you so busy?
Why did you kiss me?
Why do they do this?

Would you like that?
Wow! What a big box!

You're a bright boy.
You're looking good!

You're not to blame.
You're out of order.
You're out of order.
You're part of this.
You're really funny.

Your shoes are here.
Your zipper is open.
Yours is over there.

Are you able to swim?
Are you almost ready?
Are you freaking out?
Are you good at math?

Don't kid about that.
Don't play with fire.
Don't touch my stuff.
Don't worry about it!

Everyone likes pizza.
Get a doctor in here.
Get back to the ship.
Get me the newspaper.
Give that back to me.
Have you eaten lunch?
Have you ever smoked?

How did Tom find you?
How did Tom get hurt?
How do you stop this?
How fast did Tom run?
How long is too long?
How many people died?
I already apologized.

I am counting on you.
I asked him his name.
I ate a lot of pizza.
I begged Tom to stay.
I borrowed Tom's car.

I have been in Paris.
I have blue jeans on.
I have good eyesight.
I have to prioritize.
I just need a second.
I knew I could do it.
I knew you'd make it.
I know it's not easy.
I know where that is.
I left home at seven.
I like your attitude.
I mean no disrespect.
I need a bigger bowl.
I need an answer now.
I need time to think.
I need to go to work.
I need to read a lot.
I need to see it now.
I put on my trousers.
I regret going there.
I rejected the offer.
I said don't do that.
I said we'll get one.
I showed her my room.
I started this topic.
I studied last night.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom needs me.
I think that's great.
I think they like us.
I think you like Tom.
I think you're right.
I thought I knew you.
I tried to phone you.
I underestimated Tom.
I usually go on foot.
I want one like that.
I want some of those.
I want the other one.
I wanted to help you.
I was at the library.
I was disgusted, too.
I won the gold medal.
I won't let you jump.
I won't stand for it.
I worked a lot today.
I'd like to help you.
I'll be back at 6:30.
I'll call the police.
I'll give him a buzz.
I'll gladly help you.
I'll go look for Tom.
I'll have to do that.
I'll phone you later.
I'm afraid he is ill.
I'm allergic to corn.
I'm almost done here.
I'm furious with Tom.
I'm glad you're glad.
I'm going to see Tom.
I'm in the same boat.
I'm just making sure.
I'm just watching TV.
I'm not going to die.
I'm not here for you.
I'm not tired at all.
I'm rather impressed.
I'm sorry I woke you.
I'm studying English.
I'm sure they'll win.
I'm sure they'll win.
I'm unnecessary here.
I've come a long way.
I've got a flat tire.
I've got a lot to do.
I've got to call Tom.
I've lost my car key.
I've made a decision.
I've made a decision.
Is there anyone here?
Is this pencil yours?
It gets on my nerves.
It is out of fashion.
It'll take some time.
It's all Greek to me.
It's better that way.
It's bigger than Tom.
It's happened before.
It's just over there.
It's not a bad thing.
It's not complicated.
It's right above you.
It's still happening.
It's very cold today.
Just throw them away.
Let go of the bottle.
Let me say one thing.
Let's check it later.
Let's get some lunch.
Let's get some lunch.
Let's get some lunch.
Let's sing and dance.
Let's try once again.
Mary is Tom's cousin.
May I see that again?
May I use your phone?
My bag is very heavy.
My decision is final.
My school has a band.
My sister is a nurse.
Nightmares are scary.
Nightmares are scary.
Nightmares are scary.
Nobody calls me that.
Nobody supported her.
Open your mouth wide.
People here love you.
Please don't hang up.
Please insert a coin.
Please remain seated.
Please shut the door.
Please telephone him.
Please telephone him.
Promise me one thing.
Raise your left hand.
Say that you love me.
She bought him a car.
She fell on her face.
She gets up at seven.
She gets up at seven.
She is in a bad mood.
She is living abroad.
She opens the window.
She picked up a coin.
She raised her voice.
She sang pretty well.
She sent me a letter.

I hardly ever do that.
I have a great memory.
I have a slight fever.
I have an old bicycle.
I have just come here.
I have lost my camera.
I heard the bell ring.
I hope you don't mind.

It didn't hurt at all.
It is too warm for me.
It seemed appropriate.
It serves our purpose.
It was Saturday night.
It would be confusing.
It's Monday, you know.
It's a bad investment.
It's a quarter to two.
It's been a hard year.
It's from your family.
It's just so exciting.
It's more than enough.
It's still true today.
It's useless to argue.
Keep up the good work.
Let's build something.
Let's build something.

Look at that building.
Look what you've done.
Many people are upset.
May I borrow your pen?
May I come right over?
May I escort you home?
May I sit next to you?
May I take your order?
My car wouldn't start.
My cat will love this.
My shopping bag broke.
No one cares about me.
No one speaks with me.
Nobody encouraged her.
Nobody here does that.
Nobody knows his name.
Nobody's going to die.
Please leave me alone.
Please let me go home.
Please light a candle.
Red is out of fashion.
Shall I check the oil?

Something's not right.
Something's not right.
Thank you for calling.
Thank you for writing.
Thanks to both of you.
That could take hours.
That could take weeks.

That sounds promising.
That was an awful day.
That was sweet of you.
That wouldn't be good.
That's Tom's decision.

It's your turn to sing.
Keep away from the dog.
Leave that stuff alone.
Leave us alone, please.

Let's go grab a burger.
Let's go grab a burger.

My son can't count yet.
My time is running out.
No one could deny this.

Pandas are very clever.
People expect too much.

Tom was right after all.
Tom was waiting for you.
Tom will find something.
Tom won't do that again.
Tom won't go to college.
Tom won't pass the test.
Tom wouldn't believe us.
Tom's dog attacked Mary.
Was that you in the car?
Watch what you're doing!
Water is very important.
We almost never eat out.
We are a family of five.
We are free from danger.
We don't belong in here.
We don't have a problem.
We have enough food now.
We have three daughters.
We know it was our duty.
We must change our plan.
We must help each other.
We named the dog Cookie.
We really appreciate it.
We reported him missing.
We should do this again.
We talked for some time.
We used to call him Tom.
We want to see the king.
We were welcomed warmly.
We'd better go help Tom.
We'll attack at sunrise.
We're coming to get you.
We're just good friends.
We've all been laid off.
We've looked everywhere.
Were you married to Tom?
What are we waiting for?
What are you driving at?
What do you take me for?
What do you want to eat?
What does PTA stand for?
What does it taste like?
What does it taste like?
What is Gestalt Therapy?

What're you saying, Tom?
What's that awful sound?
What's your middle name?
What's your mother like?
When did he come of age?
When did you go to work?
When do you return home?
When's Tom going to eat?
Where are you taking me?

Where on earth were you?
Where's your black suit?
Which one do you prefer?
Which one of you is Tom?
Which team won the game?
Who took these pictures?
Who wants hot chocolate?
Who were you there with?
Who were you there with?
Who will host the party?
Who's coming for dinner?
Whose newspaper is this?
Whose newspaper is this?
Why are you helping Tom?
Why are you so insecure?
Why aren't you in there?
Why did Tom yell at you?
Write your address here.
You are a good customer.
You are in a safe place.
You can put it anywhere.
You can swim, can't you?
You can't make us leave.
You can't prove a thing.
You don't have to hurry.
You don't have to hurry.
You don't smoke, do you?
You have real potential.
You have very sexy legs.
You have what they want.
You know that I'm right.
You know what it's like.
You know why we're here.
You know why, don't you?
You like him, don't you?
You may use his library.
You never learn, do you?
You or I will be chosen.
You really are hopeless.
You really need a woman.
You said you were ready.
You scared the children.
You seem to be relieved.
You should go on a diet.
You should look into it.
You should not go alone.
You should see a doctor.
You should see a doctor.
You'll do no such thing.
You'll have a hard time.
You'll want to see this.
You're driving me crazy.
You're making me hungry.
You're not good at this.
You're not making sense.
You're not welcome here.
You're right, as always.
You're wrong about that.
Your friend is tiresome.
A gentle wind is blowing.
Accidents are inevitable.
All but one were present.
All the other kids do it.
All these books are mine.
All we want to do is eat.
Are they speaking French?
Are those your daughters?
Are you a coffee drinker?
Are you from Boston, too?
Are you going to ask Tom?
Are you going to give up?
Are you going to help us?
Are you going to stop me?

Are you on your way home?
Are you planning to stay?
Are you still seeing Tom?
Are you sure Tom is here?

Ask me anything you want.
Ask your dad to help you.

Can I help you with that?
Can I take pictures here?
Can I take pictures here?
Can I use your telephone?
Can you do it in one day?
Can you help me find out?
Can you order one for me?
Can't we just be friends?
Could we talk in private?
Could you leave us alone?
Could you say that again?
Could you say that again?
Curiosity killed the cat.
Death is everyone's fate.
Dental care is expensive.
Did I hurt your feelings?
Did you buy the medicine?
Did you go to the doctor?
Did you just call me Tom?
Did you see the accident?
Did you want to sit down?
Didn't you hear a scream?
Do as I say, not as I do.
Do you even remember Tom?
Do you find that amusing?
Do you have a smartphone?
Do you have a smartphone?

Do you still believe Tom?
Do you think I want this?
Do you think that's wise?
Do you trust my judgment?
Do you want to know more?
Do you want to risk that?
Does anybody want a beer?
Dogs can see in the dark.
Don't disappoint me, Tom.
Don't forget to buy milk.
Don't forget your jacket.
Don't forget your things.
Don't let go of the rope.
Don't make fun of others.
Don't open those windows.
Don't overexert yourself.
Don't think I didn't try.
Don't you have any money?
Don't you move from here.
Each player did his best.
Everybody makes mistakes.
Everyone knew what to do.
Excuse me, may I come in?
Few people have two cars.
Give me something to eat.
Have you been here since?
Have you eaten lunch yet?
Have you ever sold a car?
Have you found something?
Have you paid your taxes?
Have you seen my red tie?
Have you tried it before?

I almost dropped a plate.
I am content with my job.
I apologized immediately.
I asked Tom if he was OK.
I asked around about Tom.
I assumed you would come.
I came here to thank you.

I can't take it any more.
I can't thank you enough.
I can't wait to meet Tom.
I come here every Monday.
I could not speak to him.
I deserve an explanation.
I didn't even notice you.
I didn't wake you, did I?
I do want to go with you.
I don't like you anymore.
I don't think you're fat.
I don't want 2013 to end.
I don't want to eat this.
I forgot our anniversary.
I get what you're saying.
I go to church every day.
I got used to it quickly.
I grew up in the country.
I hadn't thought of that.
I handed the mike to him.
I hate to contradict you.
I hate to contradict you.
I hate when that happens.
I have a message for Tom.
I have a pain in my foot.
I have good news for you.
I have many things to do.
I have seen a panda once.
I have to do my homework.
I have to give it to Tom.
I have to pass this exam.
I haven't broken any law.
I haven't slept for days.
I hear footsteps outside.
I heard that Tom is sick.
I hope Tom is optimistic.

I hope you're having fun.
I kind of agree with you.
I knew you'd like Boston.

I sure hope you're right.
I think I've seen enough.
I think that Tom is tall.
I think this one is good.
I think we should go now.
I thought I was dreaming.
I thought you'd be happy.
I totally agree with Tom.
I usually wake up at six.
I visited her in Germany.
I want Tom to look at me.
I want Tom to understand.
I want to be an engineer.
I want to know your name.
I want to live in a town.
I want to live like that.
I want to see my parents.
I want to speak with Tom.
I want to understand Tom.
I wanted to learn French.
I was advised to do that.
I was at a movie theater.
I was in Tokyo yesterday.
I was taken advantage of.
I will be busy next week.
I will be sixteen in May.
I will explain it to him.
I wish today were Monday.
I worked in this factory.
I would do it if I could.
I would never betray you.
I would never lie to you.

I'm doing the best I can.
I'm in a really bad mood.
I'm not asking for money.
I'm not feeling too well.
I'm not giving up on you.
I'm not happy about this.
I'm not sure I want that.
I'm on the football team.
I'm so happy for you two.
I'm so happy you're here.
I'm sure you'll like Tom.
I'm worth more than this.
I've been here for hours.
I've come to say goodbye.
I've found something out.
I've got some work to do.
I've just come to Boston.
I've never been so moved.
I've never been so tired.
I've never killed anyone.
If Tom goes, I will, too.
In a word, life is short.
Is it anything like mine?
Is there any mail for me?
It doesn't belong to you.
It doesn't belong to you.
It is nice and cool here.
It is quite a big number.
It is really nice of you.
It looks like Tom is shy.
It must be past midnight.
It was a foolish mistake.
It wasn't much of a view.
It's a complicated story.
It's cool today for July.
It's for my personal use.
It's not against the law.
It's not anybody's fault.
It's very stuffy in here.
Just answer one question.
Keep your cigarettes dry.
Let me have a look at it.
Let me have a look at it.
Let me know your address.
Let me pick up the check.
Let's catch a quick bite.
Let's find another place.
Let's hope Tom was right.
Let's play hide and seek.
Let's share the expenses.
Look at what you've done.
Look, I'm not doing this.
Mary has not started yet.
Mary likes to bake bread.
Mary wore a simple dress.
May I see a menu, please?
May I show you something?
Maybe Tom tried too hard.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
My girlfriend is Chinese.
My heart goes out to you.
My sister jogs every day.
My sister likes painting.
My swimsuit is too tight.
My university has a dorm.
My wife thinks I'm crazy.
No one was badly injured.
No one will believe them.
Nobody came to my rescue.
Nobody can understand it.
Nothing much has changed.
Now I feel sorry for her.
Now let's begin the game.
One can always find time.
Please don't go in there.
Please don't use my name.
Please have some cookies.
Please send an ambulance.
Please speak more slowly.
Please take off your hat.
Please tell me your name.
Please wait half an hour.
Please water the flowers.
Politics leaves him cold.
See you at work tomorrow.
She barely ate her lunch.
She divorced her husband.
She dyed her hair blonde.
She gave me a dirty look.
She is putting on weight.
She means nothing to him.
She prefers beer to wine.
She refused his proposal.
She unbuttoned her shirt.
She wanted to flatter me.
She was voted prom queen.
She will fail eventually.
She's acting on instinct.
Someone will do that job.
Take a good look at this.
Take as many as you want.
Take as much as you like.
Take this to your mother.
Tell me what it was like.
Thank you all for coming.
That is why he got angry.
That was a good decision.
That's a pathetic excuse.
That's not very romantic.
That's not what Tom says.
That's not what you said.
That's quite a risky job.
That's what terrifies me.
The Hilton Hotel, please.
The babies are screaming.
The baby is crawling now.
The book costs 4 dollars.
The climate here is mild.
The dog seems to be sick.
The door remained closed.
The first lesson is easy.
The law has been changed.
The monks are meditating.
The nail tore his jacket.
The paint is peeling off.
The road is under repair.
The weather is beautiful.
There is no time to lose.
There isn't any solution.
There was no alternative.
There's a lot of traffic.
There's a lot to discuss.
There's been no one here.
There's no shame in that.
There's not enough water.
There's only one problem.
There's snow on the roof.
There's still a lot left.
These socks do not match.
They aren't coming today.

They exchanged greetings.
They're on the same team.

God knows that it is true.
Good luck. You'll need it.

I was trying to kill time.
I was very busy yesterday.
I will help you all I can.
I wish you didn't do that.

I've got to get some milk.
I've never enjoyed flying.
I've received your letter.
If only I could sing well.
If you heat ice, it melts.
If you want to talk, talk.
Is money important to you?
Is that why you called me?
Is the cafeteria open yet?
Is there a telephone here?
Is there anybody in there?
Is this the train station?
Isn't that why we're here?
It could be a big problem.
It doesn't get any easier.
It doesn't seem very fair.
It isn't going to be easy.
It makes me kind of happy.
It may or may not be true.
It sounded too farfetched.
It was a revelation to me.
It was a very cold winter.
It was just the beginning.
It was overcast yesterday.
It wouldn't have mattered.
It's a very good question.
It's easier than it looks.
It's impossible to fix it.
It's just started raining.
It's neither good nor bad.
It's not always like this.
It's not exactly a secret.
It's time to do something.
It's true that she's dead.
It's virtually impossible.
It's your fault, not mine.
Leaves fall in the autumn.
Let me go in place of him.
Let me help you with that.
Let's just get rid of Tom.
Let's run to the bus stop.
Life is full of mysteries.

Perhaps you'll reconsider.
Please lend me your knife.
Please let me go with you.
Please take a deep breath.
Please turn off the light.

We could do with their help.
We didn't even get that far.
We don't have time for this.
We don't have to watch this.
We drink our tea with sugar.
We flew across the Atlantic.
We had a minor disagreement.
We have a lot of work to do.
We have less than two hours.
We have nothing else to eat.
We have to continue working.
We have you to thank for it.
We just have to do our best.
We kept together for safety.
We must concentrate on that.
We must never do this again.
We need to be more like Tom.
We ought to help each other.
We ought to leave Tom alone.
We started at the same time.
We want you to feel welcome.
We went to the park to play.
We will be together forever.
We'd better call the doctor.
We'd better call the police.
We'll definitely invite Tom.
We'll do what we have to do.
We're going out for Chinese.
We're going to name him Tom.
We're still looking for Tom.
We've dodged another bullet.
We've got nothing in common.

What has that to do with me?
What is it that bothers you?
What languages do you speak?
What ship did Tom arrive on?
What time should I check in?
What type of person are you?
What you say makes no sense.
What's your opinion on that?

When do the fireworks start?
When he heard it, he jumped.
Where is the nearest bakery?

You have a very good memory.
You have no cause for anger.
You have no cause for anger.
You have to clean your room.
You have to go to the party.
You know it as well as I do.
You may leave your bag here.

You should ask Tom yourself.
You should go to the doctor.
You should take up knitting.

You're no younger than I am.
You're starting to annoy me.
You're welcome to wait here.
You've been at it for hours.
You've been at it for hours.
You've been unusually quiet.
You've been very good to me.
You've given me good advice.
Your question has no answer.
"You talk too much," he said.
A Mexican taught him Spanish.
A good horse knows its rider.
All the world speaks English.
Am I still on the right road?
Ambition drove him to murder.
Apparently, the bus was late.
Are you enjoying good health?
Are you going to buy the car?
Are you happy with your life?
Are you meeting someone here?
Are you miserable doing that?
Are you still angry with Tom?
Aren't you going to thank me?
At last, I completed my work.
Boston is where it all began.
Both of them seem suspicious.
Bring me two pieces of chalk.
Bring me two pieces of chalk.
Can I borrow your hair drier?
Can I catch a taxi near here?
Can you tell me your address?
Cheese doesn't digest easily.
Come on, let's do this again.
Consider this a warning, Tom.

Criminals should be punished.

Don't make a scene in public.
Don't make fun of old people.
Don't worry. Everything's OK.
Don't you see the connection?
Don't you want to go with us?
Everyone admired his courage.
Everything has to be perfect.
Everything he said was right.
Funny, I don't remember that.
Hardly anybody's happy today.
Have you already fed the dog?
Have you ever been to Africa?
Have you ever been to France?
Have you ever eaten raw fish?
Have you ever heard Tom sing?
Have you gone completely mad?
Have you heard the good news?

I always wanted a sports car.
I am taking French next year.
I am taking French next year.
I came in through the window.
I can relate to how you feel.

I study English after dinner.
I study English after dinner.
I suggest we take the stairs.
I suppose you think I'm rich.

I think she is a good dancer.
I think that's a stupid idea.
I think that's too expensive.
I think we need more cookies.
I think we're going to be OK.

I want to go there once more.
I want to know what you know.
I want to tell her the truth.
I want to work at a hospital.
I want you to leave us alone.
I want you to meet my cousin.
I wanted to say hello to Tom.
I was happy to see her again.
I was hoping you'd come back.
I was just about to say that.
I was never in love with Tom.
I was tired after doing that.
I was told you were reliable.
I was unaware of the problem.
I wasn't expecting you today.
I will quit smoking for good.
I wish I could talk about it.
I wish that I could help you.
I wish that I could help you.
I wish you'd never been born.
I wonder why Tom bought that.

I would like a word with Tom.
I wrote a long letter to him.
I'd be happy to sing for you.

I'm in a desperate situation.
I'm not telling you his name.
I'm not the one who told Tom.
I'm not your husband anymore.
I'm really happy that we won.
I'm really scared of spiders.
I'm sorry I can't come today.
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.
I'm still not happy about it.
I'm still not talking to you.
I'm supposed to wait for Tom.
I'm sure Tom is exaggerating.
I'm the shortest person here.
I'm thinking of going abroad.
I've been watching you study.
I've fixed the radio for him.
I've got a lot of work to do.
I've just finished breakfast.
If I were you, I'd ignore it.
If anyone can do it, you can.
In fact, you are quite right.
Inoue doesn't like computers.
Is that machine still usable?
Is that supposed to scare me?
Is there a place I can smoke?
Is your father in the garden?
It doesn't make a difference.
It is dangerous to swim here.
It is easy to read this book.
It is four centimeters thick.
It rained hard the whole day.
It told Tom that I was sorry.
It was a warm summer evening.
It was all covered with dust.
It was dark under the bridge.
It was just a matter of time.
It was nice meeting you here.
It wasn't like that at first.
It won't make any difference.
It's beyond my comprehension.
It's difficult to please Tom.
It's important to read books.
It's never too late to start.
It's not worth arguing about.
It's well past Tom's bedtime.
Keep an eye on this suitcase.
Let us know if you're coming.
Let us know if you're coming.
Let's let bygones be bygones.
Let's sit down on that bench.
Let's start at the beginning.
Let's wait until six o'clock.

Thanks for bringing Tom home.
That girl has become a woman.
That goes against my beliefs.
That movie was really boring.
That thought crossed my mind.
That was the answer I wanted.
That's none of your business.
That's what I should've done.
That's where you're mistaken.

How do you suggest we proceed?
How long did you work for Tom?
How long did you work for Tom?
How many books do you possess?
How much did you pay for that?
How sure are you it's not Tom?
How was the weather yesterday?
I admire you for your courage.
I am interested in this story.
I apologize if I offended you.
I asked Tom to help out today.
I believe that it can be done.
I bought a book about animals.
I can't depend on you anymore.
I can't run as fast as he can.
I can't see a way out of this.
I caught a big fish yesterday.
I couldn't have done it alone.
I dealt him a blow on the ear.
I didn't ask Tom to come here.

I didn't expect you to answer.
I didn't know who else to ask.
I didn't mean to make Tom cry.
I didn't pay attention to him.
I didn't think you would come.
I didn't think you would come.
I didn't want to look foolish.

I fail to see what's so funny.
I felt it was my duty to come.
I go shopping every other day.

I guess you don't remember me.
I had no idea you could dance.
I had some calls to make, too.
I have a black dog named Tiki.

I put some cream in my coffee.
I quit smoking six months ago.
I read this article yesterday.
I really don't have much time.
I really enjoyed your company.
I really liked talking to Tom.
I should've apologized to Tom.
I spoke as quietly as I could.
I talk to myself all the time.
I talked with her for an hour.
I think I'll get back to work.
I think I'll go back to sleep.
I think Tom used to date Mary.
I think it won't be a problem.

I was hoping to find you here.
I was impressed with her work.
I was moved by their kindness.
I was speechless with emotion.
I wear jeans almost every day.
I will have to work on Sunday.
I will play football tomorrow.
I wish I were as young as you.
I wish she would stop smoking.
I wish you could come with us.
I woke up when the phone rang.
I wonder what happened to Tom.
I wonder why Tom was arrested.
I wonder why Tom was murdered.
I wouldn't have dreamed of it.
I wrote down her phone number.
I wrote this letter in French.
I'd like to ask you about Tom.
I'd like to buy this computer.
I'd like to know your opinion.
I'd like to sit by the window.
I'd rather stay home and knit.
I'll be thinking of you today.
I'll be thinking of you today.
I'll bring it to you tomorrow.
I'll give you one more chance.
I'll go find out where Tom is.

I'm beginning to enjoy myself.
I'm feeling good this morning.
I'm going to go find a doctor.
I'm going to go take a shower.
I'm going to my grandmother's.
I'm just glad Tom wasn't hurt.
I'm learning French on my own.
I'm not as stubborn as Tom is.
I'm not going to say it twice.
I'm not sure why they do that.
I'm not trying to impress you.
I'm not trying to impress you.
I'm not very good at swimming.
I'm sorry I called you a liar.
I'm sorry about the other day.
I'm sorry for being so clumsy.
I'm sure it could be arranged.
I'm sure the two of you agree.
I'm taking a shower right now.
I'm used to this cold weather.
I'm usually awake by 8:00 a.m.
I'm waiting for Tom to return.
I've already finished my work.
I've asked Tom not to do that.
I've been here for three days.
I've been offered another job.
I've seen this picture before.
I've written a lot of stories.

It is a typical Gothic church.
It is clear what must be done.
It is like the air we breathe.
It is never too late to learn.
It is thirty meters in length.
It is twenty minutes past ten.
It rained for hours and hours.
It seems to run in the family.
It snowed for three more days.
It was not a complete victory.
It was only a partial success.
It was well worth the trouble.
It's a closely guarded secret.
It's about the size of an egg.
It's absolutely unprecedented.
It's four o'clock by my watch.
It's not as easy as you think.
It's not just about the money.
It's not like I want you here.
It's not really a competition.
It's not the same without you.
It's not your problem, anyway.
I’m on a diet at the moment.
Japan consumes a lot of paper.
Lavender is my favorite plant.
Learn something new every day.
Let's come up with a new plan.
Let's discuss this over lunch.

Six squared equals thirty-six.
Some songs come from Scotland.
Some words are hard to define.
Tell me exactly what happened.
Tell me what I should've done.
Tell me what you did in Tokyo.
Thanks for the delicious meal.
That didn't bother Tom at all.
That leaves no room for doubt.
That man has a bad reputation.
That movie star has many fans.
That sounds like a great idea.
That was the worst movie ever.
That's exactly what I thought.
That's not where I want to go.
That's the crux of the matter.
That's what Tom wants to know.
That's what's great about Tom.
